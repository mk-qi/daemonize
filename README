README - daemonize

The code is published under the MIT - License.
You can have a look at it in the LICENSE file.

Main purpose for writing this code was to get into KDevelop and CMake.
Also I didn't know that you should take special actions to create a daemon and
wanted to save the code somewhere if I need to quickly access to it.
